### Here is the schematic of sensors circuit. 16 pins are enough for our project, so we only used a header with 16 Pins.   
J2 is for PIR sensor  
J3 is for humidity&temperature sensor   
J4 is for GPIO  
R1 and R2 are the pull-up resistors   
D1 LED is for the motor test. This signal is used to control motor.  
D2 LED is for observation. It will show if the circuit is working.

### Here is the Schematic of Motor driver circuit. 
J1 is for Power source.  
J2 is for Motor.  
J3 is for Control signal that comes from the GPIO.  
J4 is for switch.  
Q1 is to control the motor.  
D2 LED is to check if the circuit works properly.

  #### PCB Artwork  
   PCB Artwork in the circuit designing process refers to the planning and placing of electrical traces and via holes to connect every component mounted on the board with each other.  
   PCB Artwork rules/guidelines is used as a base for the circuit design to facilitate a standard design and manufacturing procedures.
